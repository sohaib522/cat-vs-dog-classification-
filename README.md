# cat-vs-dog-classification-
This project is based on kaggle's competition to correctly classify image as dog or cat.

Size of training dataset is 20000 and size of validation dataset is 5000.

Pre-trained model Resnet50 with 50 layers  is used for training dataset
Resnet50 gives us amazing accuracy of 0.97 ( reducing computational and time cost) with only just Epoch.

Model is saved in cloud ( in drive) for later use.

At the end submission.csv is created containing all the predictions for unseen data
